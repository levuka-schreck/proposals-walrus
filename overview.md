Proficiency in Solidity, Rust, Move language, and protocols such as ERC-20/721/1155, with experience in gas optimization, tokenomics, cross-chain bridges, and zk-Proofs for privacy-enhanced applications.

### Frontend and dApp Integration 
Expertise in React/Next.js, TypeScript/JavaScript, WalletConnect, MetaMask, and Rewon App Kit for building intuitive, mobile-responsive UIs with seamless wallet connectivity and on-chain interactions.

### Backend and API Development 
Strong command of Node.js, Express.js, NestJS, Django, and databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQL/NoSQL for scalable microservices, API design, and secure data handling.

### DevOps and Infrastructure 
Skilled in Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform/Pulumi, AWS, Vercel, and observability tools for robust deployments, containerization, and infrastructure-as-code.

### Security and Compliance 
Experience in smart contract auditing (using tools like Slither, Mythril), threat modeling, KYC/AML integration, and secure key management to ensure regulatory compliance and user trust.

## Additional Tools and Methodologies 
Agile/Scrum practices, Git/GitHub, testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, Selenium), and specialized blockchain tools like Hardhat, Truffle, Foundry, Polkadot SDK, and Sui RPC for efficient development and debugging.  Our team members have delivered production-grade solutions, including non-custodial wallets, DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and Agri-tech blockchain systems, often integrating third-party SDKs and optimizing for performance in high-stakes environments.
